...is a fast and minimalist llm-powered text editor.
1. Setup your instruction (extend/summarise/fix typos)
2. Copy or enter the source text
3. Wait for the LLM to generate the output

The corresponging substrings in the texts are highlighted so you can easily find what is what in the output 

## Setup
1. Install the packages specified in the requirements.txt with pip utility
2. Download the language model in GGUF format and place it in the same folder as the .py file. I recommend [TheBloke/dolphin-2_6-phi-2-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/dolphin-2_6-phi-2-GGUF) since it is fast and has a nice performance ;)
